# XelloAssesmentApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

------NOTE-----

For this project I have added two different methods of generating tooltips. I have created a re-usable directive (this is what is currently being used), as well as a component. To use the component a few things must be commented back in / out. Reach me at joshlemieux555@gmail.com if you would like the steps to test the component. Otherwise to run the app 

## Development server
Run 'npm install'
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
